## 📖 Introduction

**X-Critical** is a specialized AI evaluation system designed to combat "score inflation" and "mediocrity" in media reviews (Anime, Manga, Visual Novels, Novels). 

Unlike traditional review aggregators that average user scores, X-Critical employs a strict, philosophy-driven algorithm to filter for masterpieces that achieve extremity in either **Logos (Reason)** or **Pathos (Emotion)**.

It utilizes a **Hybrid Architecture** combining Gemini 3.0 Pro's internal knowledge base with real-time Google Search grounding, orchestrated by the custom **ABBF (Adaptive Bayesian-Bandwagon Filtering)** algorithm to detect and mitigate review bombing or controversial bias.

---

## 🧠 Core Philosophy & Logic

The system rejects the "Jack-of-all-trades" approach. 
> *A work with no flaws but no soul is rejected (**OUT**).* > *A work with significant flaws but a transcendent core is accepted (**IN**).*

### 1. The 6-Dimensional Metric (0.0 - 5.0)

| Symbol | Metric | Definition |
| :---: | :--- | :--- |
| **E** | **Logos / Reason** | Logical consistency, philosophical depth, thematic complexity. |
| **A** | **Pathos / Emotion** | Character arcs, emotional resonance, catharsis. |
| **C** | **Techne / Craft** | Narrative structure, pacing, audiovisual execution. |
| **O** | **Originality** | Novelty, boundary-pushing concepts, unique twists. |
| **U** | **Unity** | Pacing consistency, narrative closure, lack of plot holes. |
| **R** | **Resonance** | Post-completion impact, re-watch value, "brain rot" factor. |

### 2. The ABBF Algorithm
**Adaptive Bayesian-Bandwagon Filtering**

This is the core risk-control engine designed to handle **polarized masterpieces** (e.g., *Yosuga no Sora*, *Mushoku Tensei*) which often suffer from moralistic review bombing.

#### 🔄 Logic Flow
1.  **Consensus Check**: The system analyzes the distribution of online search results.
    * **High Consensus**: Trust the wisdom of the crowd ($\alpha \approx 1$).
    * **Polarized**: Distrust the crowd ($\alpha \to 0$), rely on local AI judgment.
2.  **Taboo Tax Detection**: If a work scores high in Local Analysis (`E/A > 4.5`) but low Online, and contains sensitive themes (Taboo, Gore, Politics), the system flags it as `"Review Bombing"`.

#### ⚖️ Dynamic Weighting
* **Objective Metrics (C/U)**: Heavily weighted towards **Online Consensus** (masses rarely lie about animation quality).
* **Subjective Metrics (E/A/R)**: Heavily weighted towards **Local AI** (masses often fail to understand nuance in controversial works).

## 🛠️ Prompt Design & Engineering

The prompt architecture is split into two distinct stages to ensure data purity.

### Stage 1: Local Analysis (Isolation Mode)
* **Goal**: Extract the model's "unbiased" internal knowledge without noise from the internet.
* **Technique**: `tools: []` (No tools allowed).
* **Prompt Key**:
    > "Assume your internal knowledge is absolute truth. Ignore public opinion."

### Stage 2: Hybrid Analysis (Calibration Mode)
* **Goal**: Calibrate scores against reality and apply ABBF.
* **Technique**: `tools: [{ googleSearch: {} }]`.
* **Prompt Key**:
    > "Analyze the DISTRIBUTION of opinions, not just the average."
    > "Detect 'Moral Panic' or 'Review Bombing'."
    > "Calculate blending coefficient Omega."
* **Data Control**: The prompt explicitly forces the model to output a JSON structure containing `source_analysis` metadata to visualize *why* it made a decision (e.g., `"Taboo Tax Detected: 80%"`).

## 🚀 Running Locally

### Prerequisites
* Node.js 18+

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/x-critical.git](https://github.com/yourusername/x-critical.git)
    cd x-critical
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure API Key**
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your Google Gemini API key:
    ```env
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
    ```
    *(Note: Ensure your env variable matches the implementation in your code, usually prefixed with VITE_ for Vite projects)*

4.  **Run the app**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

## ⚖️ Disclaimer

> [!WARNING]
> **Subjectivity**: This tool uses AI to simulate critical analysis. While rigorous, it is ultimately an emulation of subjective critique.

> [!NOTE]
> **Hallucinations**: Like all LLMs, Gemini may occasionally hallucinate plot details or studio information, especially for obscure works.

> [!TIP]
> **Scoring**: The scores are algorithmically generated estimates and should not be taken as absolute objective truth.
